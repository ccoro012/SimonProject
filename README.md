EE120B Custom Project Lab - "Simon Game"


Custom Project Proposal:
Simon Project

Introduction
	My custom lab project will be to build and program a “Simon” game. The game will display patterns in four different LEDs. The object of the game is to quickly memorize the flashing pattern and input the correct pattern sequence. Nine correct sequences and the user will win the game. Any mistake while inputting the sequence and the user will lose.

Components
	This project will use one ATMEGA1284, an LCD screen, four buttons, and four LED lights.

Milestones
	The first milestone is to have a working “controller”, which would be the 4 buttons. These 4 buttons, when pressed, will light up a corresponding LED. This will help in showing the user visually his pattern input and for storing the user’s pattern.
	The second milestone is to have a working game screen with the LCD. LCD will display a welcome screen. The game will not start until the start button is pressed. The screen will display the current level and score of the player. It will also display a message if the user wins or loses. Finally, it will ask the user if they wish to play again.
	The third milestone is to construct nine different levels in the game. As the player correctly enters the LED pattern, he will proceed through the levels and they will increase in difficulty. The difficulty being that the LEDs will flash faster and have longer patterns to remember.
	The fourth and final milestone is to add a speaker that will add “game sounds” for each button press. This is an optional milestone that will depend on the time left to construct the project.
